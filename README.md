# NNJS
### Neural Networks using javascript

## Features

- **Simple neural network for single input output** pass and input and output array for example squares and it will give the output. 
- **Complex neural network which has multiple inputs and multiple outputs** Image detection using NN
- **Genarative AI** Generate output from input text. for e.g: Generates elobrated or summary of the input statement, image, etc.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need:

- A modern web browser that supports WebGL
- Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/DeepankarGupta13/NNJS.git
    ```

3. Run in your web browser.
    ```bash
        npm install
        npm run dev
    ```

### Usage

**To Use the NN**
 - Change the inputs and outputs manually in the App.js file (planning to add the input from browser)
 - Click on the button initModel on browser and now u can predict

## Technologies Used

- **HTML/CSS:** For the UI.
- **JavaScript:** To handle the logic for Neural Network.
